  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am Louis Singer, born in 1947 in Mendoza, Argentina, to a farming family. My father, Juan, was a grape grower for wine in a small family vineyard, and my mother, Rosa, was a seamstress. Our home was filled with joy and Argentine culture, with the scent of empanadas and the sounds of tango in the background. As a child, I loved nature and would spend hours in the fields with my father, learning about grape growing and helping with the harvest.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>In 1962, when I was 15, my family decided to immigrate to Israel. The move was not easy ‚Äî the language was unfamiliar, the landscapes were different, but I saw it as an adventure and a new opportunity. We arrived in the moshav of Alonim in the Jezreel Valley, a place that reminded me somewhat of the fields from my childhood.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>At the age of 18, I enlisted as a combat soldier in the Golani Brigade, and during the Six-Day War, I fought in the Sinai Peninsula. I am proud of my military service, and during my time in the army, I made hard work and dedication to the mission central elements of my worldview.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>After my military service, I immediately began working in agriculture, and not long after, I started studying agriculture at the University of Tel-Hai, which provided me with additional tools to advance and progress in the field. Over the years, I became the manager of field crops in the moshav. Throughout the years, I blended tradition with innovation, founded new agricultural ventures, and introduced advanced farming techniques.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Today, at the age of 78, I still work in the fields every morning, with the same love for the land and sense of mission. I believe in hard work, consistency, and optimism. I am proud to be a part of the moshav and to pass on my knowledge to the next generation. My life has been a journey full of challenges and successes, and I have always maintained a strong connection to my roots, both in the land and in agriculture.</p>
